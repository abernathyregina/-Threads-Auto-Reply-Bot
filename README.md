## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** â€” The automation starts from the Appilot dashboard, where the user selects which Threads accounts and conversations to monitor.  
2. **Core Logic** â€” Appilotâ€™s engine interacts with Threads via Accessibility and UI Automator to detect new comments or messages.  
3. **Automated Response** â€” Once a trigger is matched, the bot replies with predefined or AI-generated text through the device interface.  
4. **Logging & Feedback** â€” All actions are recorded in logs for review, analytics, or retraining response templates.  
5. **Recovery & Parallel Execution** â€” Failed attempts are retried with queue management, ensuring no missed messages even on multi-device setups.

**Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Espresso, Robot Framework  
**Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Bluestacks, Nox Player, Scrcpy, Firebase Test Lab, Accessibility Service
